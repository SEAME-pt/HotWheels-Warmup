Smart Pointers in C++

- Overview -

Smart pointers are C++ objects that manage dynamic memory allocation and deallocation automatically. They help avoid common issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers by ensuring that memory is correctly released when no longer needed.

- Types of smart pointers -

std::unique_ptr: Manages a unique resource, meaning it cannot be shared with other pointers. Ownership can be transferred only by moving the pointer, which is useful for exclusive ownership.

std::shared_ptr: Manages a resource that can be shared among multiple shared pointers. The resource is deallocated once all associated shared_ptrs are destroyed, thanks to reference counting.

std::weak_ptr: Provides a non-owning reference to a resource managed by shared_ptr without affecting the resource's reference count or deallocation. Useful for breaking circular references in complex data structures.

- Common Memory Issues -

Memory Leak: Occurs when dynamically allocated memory is not properly deallocated, leading to wasted memory over time. Smart pointers help prevent this by automatically releasing memory when itâ€™s no longer referenced.

Dangling Pointer: Refers to a pointer that points to a memory location that has already been freed. Accessing a dangling pointer can lead to undefined behavior. Smart pointers reduce this risk by managing the memory lifecycle.
