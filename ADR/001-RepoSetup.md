# GitHub Repository Setup

## Context
In the first days of the Warm Up each team was responsible for deciding how to setup it's repository.
There were some ideas about creating a main repository that the other teams would fork but it didn't make sense for us to do so.

## Decision
The team came to the conclusion that creating a repository from scratch would make more sense since the objective was never to merge our work with the other teams.
This main repository could then be used for the Warm Up modules and even for the main projects that would follow.
The Product Backlog would contain all the issues related to the projects that can then be filtered by the respective Sprint.
Branches are created and linked to the respective issue to better maintain the trackibility of the project itself.
These branches can only be merged through a pull request that has to be reviewed by team members.

## Consequences
This method allows the team to work simultaneously in multiple issues and branches.
By requiring a review for merging with the main branch the team members are always up-to-date on what has been done, how it was done and by who.
